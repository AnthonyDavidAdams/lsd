# Light Stimulation Device (LSD)

### DISClAIMER
USE OF THE LSD IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. FOR RESEARCH AND ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY.

## LSD MICRO

The LSD MICRO aims to be a very simple way to get started. There is only 1 LED array to drive and 1 MOSFET. Surprisingly, this has a very similar if not identical effect to the LSD MACRO.

## LSD MACRO

The LSD MACRO is a more robust design and seeks to emulate features available in the Lucia No. 3. including Multiple LEDs and a Halogen Bulb.  Note that the Lucia No. 3 is a patented product so commercial production / sale of the LSD MACRO may violate federal law.
